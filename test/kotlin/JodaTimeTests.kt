/***
 *
 * The five date-time classes that will be used most are:

Instant - Immutable class representing an instantaneous point on the time-line
DateTime - Immutable replacement for JDK Calendar
LocalDate - Immutable class representing a local date without a time (no time-zone)
LocalTime - Immutable class representing a time without a date (no time-zone)
LocalDateTime - Immutable class representing a local date and time (no time-zone)

An Instant is a good class to use for the timestamp of an event, as there is no calendar system or time-zone to worry about.
A LocalDate is a good class to use to represent a date of birth, as there is no need to refer to the time of day.
A LocalTime is a good class to use to represent the time of day that a shop opens or closes.
A DateTime is a good class to use as a general purpose replacement for the JDK Calendar class, where the time-zone information is important.
